# SunbaseData Project
 
This is the task project I have made for the SunbaseData internship.

The Unity Project contains two scenes within the "Scene" Folder, namely:
 - Client List UI:
   Regarding the first task of fetching data from an API and displaying it in a GUI.
 - Circles:
   Regarding the second task of generating circles and adding a line-crossing mechanism.

All the codes and resources used for each scene are stored in a neat manner in their respective folder.
